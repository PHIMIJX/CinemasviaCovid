			<p>The follwing are the factors that have been observed to have had
			a huge impact on local cinemas world-wide.</p>

					<h3>Streamimg</h3>
					<p>Streaming is here and streaming is now, according to
					Deloitte streaming has taken over at least 47% of cinema
					revenue during the first lockdown alone.Although streaming
					is not exactly new, its influence and status truly evolved
					over the course of the pandemic as people could not
					“physically “go to the cinema.This has led to a decline in
					cinema attendance and an increase in "Home theater attendance"
					This has also resulted in people not being interested in the cinema
					even as lockdown eased.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="IOF-col">
					<img src="images/image_search_1632840655204.jpg">
					<h3>Lack of attendance</h3>
					<p>With streaming as well as the pandemic keeping people at home, it can
					safely be said that cinemas have become a “ghost town”.Although cinemas
					have yet to be classified as a Super- spreader events,changesin prices 
					have also affected attendance rate as well as people’s attitudetowards
					cinemas being the only providers of fresh new Block Busters.Even as 
					Covid-19cases drop people have moved on to streaming and most have forgotten about
					cinemas</p>
				</div>

					<h3>Outdated Movies</h3>
					<p>With cinemas being opened and closed on the regular, it has become difficult
					for them to acquire the latest movies.According to Deloitte,cinemas used to be 
					at the top of the distribution chain but have now been completlydemoted as Box 
					offices movies can now even be found on local Television (E. g DSTV)and most 
					streaming platforms.</p>

			<h2>How Covid-19 has influenced Movie costs</h2>
			<center><hr color="DeepSkyBlue" size="4" width="48%"/></center>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="IOF-col">
					<img src="images/image_search_1632844259136.jpg">
					<h3>How have movie costs changed?</h3>
					<p>According to my survey, the most common price for one movie ticket is now between
					the range of 50- 100.This is a slight increase from a movie ticket that was sold in
					2019(Before COVID).</p>
					<br/>
					<p>The increase was due to the amount of money lost during the course of the Lockdown
					period. When cinemas finally reopened, they like all businesses were forced to suffer
					the costs of new safety protocols.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>A practical example of this is the new cleaning schedule implemented by Ster Kinekor.
					This involves cleaning before and after every movie screening.•	The pandemic has also
					forced cinemas to adopt the use of ICT tools such as a QR scanner (Ster Kinekor uses QR 
					scanners as way to scan movie tickets customers receive from the Ster Kinekor app)
					Costs have also prevented cinemas from acquiring popular safety protocols such as free masks.</p>
				</div>
				<h2>Examples of ICT tools</h2>

			<div class="row">

					<h3>Movie app:E.g Ster Kinekor app</h3>

			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<center><hr color="DeepSkyBlue" size="4" width="81%"/></center>
			<p>The follwing are the solutions cinemas have developed in
			order to adopt to the pandemic</p>
			<br/>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="IOF-col">
					<img src="images/g.jpg">
					<p>With this new age of pandemics and uncertainty cinemas
					have been forced to find new and safer ways to operate and
					generate revenue. Ster Kinekor for example has introduced the
					Ster Kinekor app. The app has been around for a while but has
					recently been optimized for use during the pandemic</p>
					<br/>
					<p>When it comes to operations cinemas have yet to find alternative
					methods of delivering their service as people legitimately have to
					be at a cinema in order to view a movie. They have instead however
					decided to try to make a night out at the movies a much cleaner and
					Covid free experience.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Some cinemas such as Ster- Kinekor have introduced sanitation
					stations around the premises as well as sealed snacks and condiments in
					order to reduce the risk of food or area contamination. The have also
					increased cleaning cycles as well as introduce non-contact payments via
					the Ster Kinekor app. Lastly cinemas  like most businesses have adapted
					to using social distancing indicators were applicable.</p>
